As a child, Elias dreamed of finding a way to bring about positive change but wasn’t sure how to turn his ideas into reality. When he discovered the environmental and health threats posed by orphaned oil and gas wells in America, he saw a clear path forward. Recognizing the danger these wells posed to homeowners and communities, Elias was inspired to take action. He established PlugWell Inc. to address this critical issue and make a difference in the lives of those affected.","2024-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","Elias Warholak",{"type":13,"children":14},"root",[15,22,26,33],{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":18,"children":19},"element","p",{},[20],{"type":21,"value":9},"text",{"type":16,"tag":23,"props":24,"children":25},"hr",{},[],{"type":16,"tag":27,"props":28,"children":30},"h2",{"id":29},"what-are-the-risks-of-unplugged-wells",[31],{"type":21,"value":32},"What are the risks of unplugged wells?",{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":34,"children":35},{},[36],{"type":21,"value":37},"Unplugged orphaned wells are silent threats that can severely impact both the environment and human health.
